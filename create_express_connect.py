"""Create Connect Express Accounts for Testing.

The aim of this script is to quickly generate Connect Express test accounts.

Testing is important to make sure your Connect integration handles different flows correctly. 
Use test mode to simulate live mode while taking advantage of Stripe-provided special tokens to make testing easier.

We use test tokens to pre-fill success verification statuses.
The following tokens can be used to test verification with Custom and Express accounts. 

Details on the accountâ€™s acceptance of the Stripe Services Agreement from Connect Express accounts needs to happen via the dashboard.
For that reason the output of this script needs to be manually accessed to accept the TOS. The output is of format:
account_id_1: Onboarding URL 1
account_id_2: Onboarding URL 2
...
account_id_n: Onboarding URL N

The output is also stored in a file express_accounts.txt on the same directory of this script with the format:
[(account_id_1, onboarding_url_1), ..., (account_id_n, onboarding_url_n)]
