# Express Connect Account Creator

The aim of this script is to quickly generate Connect Express test accounts.

## Description

Testing is important to make sure your Connect integration handles different flows correctly.
Use test mode to simulate live mode while taking advantage of Stripe-provided special tokens to make testing easier.

We use test tokens to pre-fill success verification statuses.
The following tokens can be used to test verification with Custom and Express accounts.

Details on the accountâ€™s acceptance of the Stripe Services Agreement from Connect Express accounts needs to happen via the dashboard.
For that reason the output of this script needs to be manually accessed to accept the TOS. The output is of format:
```
account_id_1: Onboarding URL 1
account_id_2: Onboarding URL 2
...
account_id_n: Onboarding URL N
```

The output is also stored in a file express_accounts.txt on the same directory of this script with the format:
```
[(account_id_1, onboarding_url_1), ..., (account_id_n, onboarding_url_n)]
```

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Python 3.4+
- Stripe Python Library
- [Register your platform](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings)

### Installing

- Just fill the `account_info.json` with the account information you want to create. The file has the following format:
```
{
    "data": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "name": "Resort Name 1",
            "country": "US"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "name": "Resort Name 2",
            "country": "US"        
        },
        ...
        {
            "number": resort_number,
            "name": "Resort Name",
            "country": "US"        
        }
    ]
}
```

### Executing program

1. Give executable privilege to `create_express_connect.py` and `purge_connect.py`

```
chmod +x create_express_connect.py
chmod +x purge_connect.py
```

2. Export your secret key as the STRIPE_API_KEY environment variable. Test mode secret keys have the prefix `sk_test*`

```
EXPORT STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_?????
```

3. Run the Account Creator

```
./create_express_connect.py
```

4. **MAKE SURE YOU LOGGED OUT OF YOUR CONSOLE BEFORE THIS STEP**. The output is displayed both in the console while running and in the `express_accounts.txt` file. Make sure to go through each of the URLs there to accept the TOS.

5. (Optional) If you want to delete all accounts created using this script, run the `purge_connect.py` script

```
./purge_connect.py
```
